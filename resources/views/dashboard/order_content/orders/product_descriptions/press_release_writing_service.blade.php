    You may be aware of the many benefits of using press releases to generate exposure to your business’s brand as well as more traffic to your website. Syndicated press releases can result in a short burst of traffic to your website and can also help to improve your SEO rankings for your business’s primary keywords. Press releases need to be written in a particular format in order to be syndicated on the widest possible number of websites. Mediocre press releases are not likely to be republished, and if they are very poorly written they can even hurt your business’s image.
